# TMDb-movie-data-Udacity-
 Investigating a dataset on movies data and trying to analyze the data by asking questions and testing theories by getting answers from the data.
This data set contains information
about 10,000 movies collected from
The Movie Database (TMDb),
including user ratings and revenue.
● Certain columns, like ‘cast’
and ‘genres’, contain multiple
values separated by pipe (|)
characters.
● There are some odd characters
in the ‘cast’ column. Don’t worry
about cleaning them. You can
leave them as is.
● The final two columns ending
with “_adj” show the budget and
revenue of the associated movie
in terms of 2010 dollars,
accounting for inflation over
time.
