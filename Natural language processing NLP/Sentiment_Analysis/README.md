# Sentiment_Analysis
Building an NLP model for sentiment analysis using a big dataset from Kaggle called: Sentiment140 dataset with 1.6 million tweets
u can find the dataset here: https://www.kaggle.com/kazanova/sentiment140

Open the sentiment.py and you will find the model building process from scratch.
I have uploaded my model in case you want to save time.




If you want to save time just download the models from the following link: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1iL8C0-Bkhphmg7WlKUN5cRicgwC1bbkc?usp=sharing

and load the models using each one library command.
