Introduction:

We will be using the wine quality data set for these exercises. 
This data set contains various chemical properties of wine, such as acidity, sugar, pH, and alcohol.
It also contains a quality metric (3-9, with highest being better) and a color (red or white).
The name of the file is data.csv.
