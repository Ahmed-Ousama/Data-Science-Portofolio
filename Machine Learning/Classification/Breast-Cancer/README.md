# Breast-Cancer

Data Description :
Introduction:

Features are computed from a digitized image of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass.

They describe the characteristics of the cell nuclei present in the image.

The 3-dimensional space is that described in: [K. P. Bennett and O. L. Mangasarian: "Robust Linear

Programming Discrimination of Two Linearly Inseparable Sets", Optimization Methods and Software
1, 1992, 23-34].

Attribute Information:
1) ID number
2) Diagnosis (M = malignant, B = benign)

Ten real-valued features are computed for each cell nucleus:

a) radius (mean of distances from the center to points on the perimeter)

b) texture (standard deviation of gray-scale values)

c) perimeter

d) area

e) smoothness (local variation in radius lengths)

f) compactness (perimeter^2 / area - 1.0)

g) concavity (severity of concave portions of the contour)

h) concave points (number of concave portions of the contour)

i) symmetry
